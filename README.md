# ReadMe Generator
# Description
This is a ReadMe generator that uses the termanal to ask you questions and the input you provide will be formatted into a ReadMe file. We used inquirer npm for this project.

# Usage
To use this you need to install the Inquirer NPM package. Once you have done that you will need to open up your termanal and run node index.js. Next you will answer the questions in the termanal. There is an option to use the editor for answers that are longer than a few sentences. After answering all of the questions you will see success in the termanal and there will be a readME file created for you.
